# Welcome to DBOS Task Scheduler!
DBOS Task Scheduler is a full-stack app built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [DBOS](https://dbos.dev).  It serves as both a demo for learning DBOS concepts and a template for building your own DBOS-powered Next.js applications.

If you like the idea of a cloud-based task scheduler with a calendar UI, you can easily customize it with your own tasks and deploy it to DBOS Cloud [DBOS Cloud](https://www.dbos.dev/dbos-cloud) for free.

## Why Use Next.js With DBOS?
Combining DBOS Transact with Next.js offers a powerful backend and frontend pairing that is easily deployed to DBOS Cloud.

While DBOS Transact provides durable backend execution, it does not include a user interface.  Next.js is an excellent complement, offering a [React](https://react.dev/)-based UI, [server-side rendering (SSR)](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/server-side-rendering) for performance, and [server actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations) for convenient data fetching and interaction.

Existing Next.js hosting options focus on serverless, CDN-heavy applications.  Running Next.js with DBOS Transact on DBOS Cloud unlocks additional benefits:
- Lightweight durable execution â€“ [Workflows](https://docs.dbos.dev/typescript/tutorials/workflow-tutorial) that run to completion exactly once.
- Background tasks and WebSockets â€“ 
- External systems integration â€“ [Place calls to external services](https://docs.dbos.dev/typescript/tutorials/step-tutorial) with much simpler error recovery.
- Simple, powerful database integration â€“ [Manage database data](https://docs.dbos.dev/typescript/tutorials/transaction-tutorial) with DBOS.
- Cron-style task scheduling â€“ Automate recurring jobs with [built-in scheduling](https://docs.dbos.dev/typescript/tutorials/scheduled-workflows).
- Built-in tracing and replay debugging â€“ [Find workflows in the dashboard](https://docs.dbos.dev/cloud-tutorials/monitoring-dashboard) and [re-run them locally](https://docs.dbos.dev/cloud-tutorials/timetravel-debugging).

# Technologies and Concepts Demonstrated
> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** The DBOS Task Scheduler app is somewhat complex, showcasing many features.  For a simpler starting point, see [dbos-nextjs-starter](https://github.com/dbos-inc/dbos-demo-apps/tree/main/typescript/dbos-nextjs-starter).

This app uses the following:
- DBOS Workflows, Transactions, and Steps â€“ Complete actions exactly once, record the results, and send notifications, without worrying about server disruptions
- [Knex](https://knexjs.org/) â€“ Type-safe database access and schema management
- DBOS Scheduled Workflows â€“ Ensure tasks are run as scheduled
- React, with [Material](https://mui.com) and [react-big-calendar](https://github.com/jquense/react-big-calendar) â€“ Present a calendar of tasks and results
- Next.js server actions â€“ Simple interaction between the browser-based client and the server
- Next.js API routes and DBOS HTTP endpoints â€“ Allow access to the server logic from clients other than Next.js
- [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) â€“ Send calendar and result updates to the browser with low latency
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) â€“ Unit test backend code
