# Welcome to DBOS Task Scheduler!
DBOS Task Scheduler is a full-stack app built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [DBOS](https://dbos.dev).  It serves as both a demo for learning DBOS concepts and a template for building your own DBOS-powered Next.js applications.

If you like the idea of a cloud-based task scheduler with a calendar UI, you can easily customize it with your own tasks and deploy it to DBOS Cloud [DBOS Cloud](https://www.dbos.dev/dbos-cloud) for free.

## Why Use Next.js With DBOS?
Combining DBOS Transact with Next.js offers a powerful backend and frontend pairing that is easily deployed to DBOS Cloud.

While DBOS Transact provides durable backend execution, it does not include a user interface.  Next.js is an excellent complement, offering a [React](https://react.dev/)-based UI, [server-side rendering (SSR)](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/server-side-rendering) for performance, and [server actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations) for convenient data fetching and interaction.

Existing Next.js hosting options focus on serverless, CDN-heavy applications.  Running Next.js with DBOS Transact on DBOS Cloud unlocks additional benefits:
- Lightweight durable execution â€“ [Workflows](https://docs.dbos.dev/typescript/tutorials/workflow-tutorial) that run to completion exactly once.
- Background tasks and WebSockets â€“ 
- External systems integration â€“ [Place calls to external services](https://docs.dbos.dev/typescript/tutorials/step-tutorial) with much simpler error recovery.
- Simple, powerful database integration â€“ [Manage database data](https://docs.dbos.dev/typescript/tutorials/transaction-tutorial) with DBOS.
- Cron-style task scheduling â€“ Automate recurring jobs with [built-in scheduling](https://docs.dbos.dev/typescript/tutorials/scheduled-workflows).
- Built-in tracing and replay debugging â€“ [Find workflows in the dashboard](https://docs.dbos.dev/cloud-tutorials/monitoring-dashboard) and [re-run them locally](https://docs.dbos.dev/cloud-tutorials/timetravel-debugging).

# Technologies and Concepts Demonstrated
> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** The DBOS Task Scheduler app is somewhat complex, showcasing many features.  For a simpler starting point, see [dbos-nextjs-starter](https://github.com/dbos-inc/dbos-demo-apps/tree/main/typescript/dbos-nextjs-starter).

This app uses the following:
- DBOS Workflows, Transactions, and Steps â€“ Complete actions exactly once, record the results, and send notifications, without worrying about server disruptions
- [Knex](https://knexjs.org/) â€“ Type-safe database access and schema management
- DBOS Scheduled Workflows â€“ Ensure tasks are run as scheduled
- React, with [Material](https://mui.com) and [react-big-calendar](https://github.com/jquense/react-big-calendar) â€“ Present a calendar of tasks and results
- Next.js server actions â€“ Simple interaction between the browser-based client and the server
- Next.js API routes and DBOS HTTP endpoints â€“ Allow access to the server logic from clients other than Next.js
- [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) â€“ Send calendar and result updates to the browser with low latency
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) â€“ Unit test backend code

# Running DBOS Task Scheduler

## Running Locally
Once you have a copy of the DBOS Task Scheduler locally, run the following:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Note that this requires a Postgres database.  If your local environment is set up with database connection settings, these will be used.  Otherwise, the database wizard will try to start a Postgres docker image, or provision a cloud instance of Postgres for you.

When running under `npm run dev`, any changes to source files will cause the application to reload (if UI components were changed) or restart (if DBOS server components were changed).

### Production Builds

Instead of `npm run dev` it is also possible to run the following sequence of commands to run an optimized "production" build
```
npm install
npm run build
npx dbos migrate
npm run start
```

## Using The App
Once the app is running, open it in a web browser.  (By default, this will be at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/))

Upon opening the web browser (and perhaps dismissing the help popup), the main screen should open:

### Adding Tasks
To schedule a task, or repeating series, double click on open space on the calendar.  (The date and time clicked will be used for the initial population of the "Start Time" field.)

![Screen shot of the popup for adding a new task](./img/NewTaskScreen.png)

First, select a task from the "Task" dropdown.  All tasks involve fetching a URL and saving the contents.  To see what one does, select it, and press "Test".  The choices are:
- Fetch Current Time: Gets the GMT time from `http://worldtimeapi.org`
- Fetch Weather Data (New York): Gets weather data for New York from `https://api.open-meteo.com`
- Make Sure Cloud Is Up: Pulls data from a demo app on DBOS Cloud: `https://demo-guestbook.cloud.dbos.dev/`
- Fetch Random Joke: Gets a joke from `https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke`
- Stave Off Boredom: Attempts to get a random activity from `https://www.boredapi.com/api/activity`; this service may be down; more on this below
- Impossible Task: Tests errors by fetching `http://example.invalid`

Then, ensure that the "Start Time" is correct.  If not, change it.

If the task is to be a repeating task, select an "End Time", and set "Repetition" to "Daily", "Weekly", or "Monthly" as appropriate.

Selecting "Add Schedule" will put the task on the calendar, and save it to the application database, where the DBOS scheduler will pick it up and run it at the appropriate times.

### Editing/Removing Tasks
To edit or remove a task, click on the task's calendar item to reveal the "Edit/Delete Task" dialog.

![Screen shot of the popup for editing tasks](./img/EditTaskScreen.png)

Changes can be made to all fields except "Task".  Clicking "Test" will execute the task and add the result to the calendar.  Clicking "Update Schedule" will save any changes.  Clicking "Delete" will delete the task, along with all results for the task.

### Viewing Results
To view results and errors, click on the result calendar items.

## Setting Up Email Notifications
The DBOS Task Scheduler app will send notifications using Amazon Simple Email Service (SES).  To use this, set the following environment variables:
- AWS_REGION: The AWS region for SES service
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: The AWS access key provisioned for SES access
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: The access secret corresponding to AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- REPORT_EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS: The email address to use as the "from" address for results reports
- REPORT_EMAIL_TO_ADDRESS: The email address to use as the "to" address for results reports
