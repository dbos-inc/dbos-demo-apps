# Bored API

We wanted to use the "I'm Bored" functionality as part of this demo, but at the time of writing [Bored API](https://www.boredapi.com/api/activity) is not working.

Under terms of the Bored API [MIT License](./license), we have copied the ideas for things to do into this project.

The original version of this code can be found [in github](https://github.com/drewthoennes/Bored-API).
