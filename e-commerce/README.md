# Operon E-Commerce Demo Apps

Note, this demo requires four separate processes to run: front end and back end for shop and payment. 
Easiest way to do this is via the `E-Commerce` VSCode debug launch configuration.

1. initialize the four projects via `./npm-install.sh`
2. Start and configure the shop and payment databases via `./start_postgres_docker.sh`
